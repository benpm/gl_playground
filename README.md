# GL Playground

![](thumb.png)

Big mess of things including assignments for Interactive Computer Graphics, Physics-Based Animation, and Computational Geometry courses from spring 2023 at University of Utah. Things are super spread out so take a look at some of the branches

## Features
- Directional, spot, and point lights, all with basic shadow-mapping
- Interactive rigid body physics
- Multi-material objects, basic shading
- Surface nets generated in a compute shader
- Really slow softbody physics solver

## Assets
Before doing anything you need to download the externally-hosted assets. On Linux you can just run the `download_assets.sh` script. Otherwise, you'll have to [download](http://cs.utah.edu/~benpm/assets.zip) and unzip the archive manually.

## Building

### Native Builds

#### Linux
You might need to install a couple packages:
- `libxinerama-dev`
- `libglu1-mesa-dev`
- `libxi-dev`
- `ninja-build`

Then let CMake handle the rest:
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

#### Windows
Open project as a CMake project, click "Build All", and hope for the best. You might want to install Ninja.

### WebAssembly Build (NEW!)

Build for the web using Emscripten:
```bash
./build_wasm.sh
```

See [WEBGPU_BUILD.md](WEBGPU_BUILD.md) for detailed WebAssembly build instructions.

## Running

### Native
`./build/app` or `.\build\app.exe`

### Web
After building with `build_wasm.sh`:
```bash
cd dist
python3 -m http.server 8000
```
Then open http://localhost:8000 in a WebGPU-compatible browser.

## Dependencies
These dependencies are either included or managed by CMake and built locally:

- [GLFW](https://github.com/glfw/glfw)
- [eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org)
- [gleq](https://github.com/glfw/gleq)

- [spdlog](https://github.com/gabime/spdlog)
- glad
- [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt)
- [libspng](https://libspng.org)
